Reference Channel Computation
</H3>

<P>
In a typical implementation of a time-delay based beamforming
system one needs to select one of the channels as the reference
channel. This channel is compared to all others and the time delay
of arrival (TDOA) is estimated for each pair. It is important for
this channel to be the best representative of the acoustics in the
meeting, as the correct estimation of the delays of each of the
channels depends on the chosen reference.

<P>
In the meetings transcribed by NIST to be used for the Rich
Transcription evaluations (<A
 HREF="node147.html#NIST_rt_web"><EM>NIST Rich Transcription evaluations, website:
  http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/rt</EM>, 2006</A>) there is one
microphone indicated to be the most centrally located in the room.
Such microphone is chosen empirically given the room layout and
the prior knowledge of the microphone types. This module
overpasses that decision and selects one microphone automatically
given a criterion based on acoustics. This is intended for system
robustness in cases where absolutely no information on the room
layout and the microphone placements is available. Two possible
acoustic criterions were investigated to select such channel:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A selection based on <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Signal to Noise ratio</SPAN> (SNR). A
simple speech/non-speech detection based on energy is applied to
each of the channels independently and the SNR is computed. The
channel with better SNR is chosen to be the reference channel.
This poses a problem on how accurate is the speech/non-speech
detection and how it correlates between channels. The algorithm
implementation computed speech/non-speech for each channel
independently and then computed the SNR for each one, giving mixed
results. An SNR computation using some combined speech/non-speech
technique where all channels could be taken into account to come
up with one single segmentation could have improved this selection
algorithm.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A selection based on <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">average cross-correlation</SPAN>
between channels: The cross-correlation (GCC-PHAT) is computed for
all possible channel combinations for a block of duration 1s. This
is repeated for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img375.png"
 ALT="$ M=200$"></SPAN> blocks linearly spaced along the
recording. For each channel <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$ i$"></SPAN> the average cross-correlation is
computed as:

<P>
<P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><!-- MATH
 \begin{equation}
\frac{}{\mbox{cross\_correlation}_{i}} =
\frac{1}{MN}\sum_{m=1}^{M} \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{N} xcorr(i, j)

where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 SRC="img33.png"
 ALT="$ M$"></SPAN> indicates
the number of blocks used in the average. In the implementation
GCC-PHAT cross-correlation was used as described below.

<P>
The channel with the highest average cross-correlation was chosen
as reference channel. By using this metric it takes into account
the amount of time each speaker speaks in total and the quality of
each microphone. In the case where all microphones were the same
and all speakers spoke the same amount of time, the chosen
microphone should be the most physically centrally located one,
coinciding with what NIST reports in the RT evaluations.
