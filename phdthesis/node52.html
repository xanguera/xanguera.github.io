Average Speaker Turn Duration</A>
</H3>

<P>
Given the HMM acoustic modeling presented in the previous section,
a minimum duration is applied to the segment length when
performing the acoustic decoding of the data using the Viterbi
algorithm. Such segments constitute the speaker turns and
therefore it is important to analyze how long in average these are
in the different subdomains, in order to adapt (if necessary) this
parameter of the system to allow for smaller/larger turns.

<P>
In Table <A HREF="#average_turn_dur">3.12</A> the average, maximum and standard
deviation of the speaker turn duration is given both for
conference room meetings data and for the lecture room data. In
the case of the conference room data, both the manual
transcriptions and the forced-alignments are analyzed. When
analyzing this property, two speaker turns from the same speaker
but separated with a silence are considered different turns, and
their durations counted separately.

<P>
It is clear that in the lecture room data the speaker turns are in
average of much greater length, given that many times a lecturer
speaker for elongated amounts of time. In some cases though it was
seen that the transcriptions contained errors when small silence
segments needed to be transcribed as such and were included within
the speaker segment adjacent to it. The maximum speaker turn
length for these is of 1:45 minutes approx.

<P>
On the conference room data there is a difference between the two
transcriptions sources. This is mainly due to the discrepancies on
the transcription of small silences. According to NIST rules for
the evaluations, any silence segment of length greater than 0.3
seconds needs to be considered as such. This can be implemented
efficiently in the forced-alignment transcriptions but it is more
difficult to be followed by the human transcribers, leading to
longer segments being annotated.

<P>
To further illustrate the distribution of the speaker turn
durations, Figure <A HREF="#turn_duration_hist">3.3</A> shows the histogram of
all three analyzed cases, showing the durations histogram of the
first 10s, with a resolution of 0.1 second. It can be observed
that both transcriptions for the meetings conference room
recordings have a similar shape, being very pointy around 0.3s,
while the broadcast news shows reflect a broader shape. Such a
small peak duration in the conference data has a reason to be in
that overlap segmentes were also used when computing the speaker
turn duration. These segments occur when two or more people are
speaking at the same time and can just refer to people uttering
affirmative/negative responses or short sentences.

<P>

<P>
In overall, the speaker turn length of meetings is much smaller
than the average in broadcast news, which is modeled by the system
with a minimum duration of 3 seconds. Such duration would be
enough if the meetings system was evaluated using the
hand-alignments, but needs to be reduced when evaluated with
forced-alignments.
