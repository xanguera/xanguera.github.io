Use of the Estimated Delays for Speaker Diarization
</H1>

<P>
Performing an acoustic beamforming of the multiple input signals
has multiple advantages, including the simplicity of the following
speaker diarization system, which can be reused from the broadcast
news system as it only needs to compute the output for a single
acoustic channel. Another advantage is the independence of the
proposed system to the room layout and number of microphones.

<P>
By doing an acoustic beamforming there comes a drawback in that
all spatial information about the speaker location, which is
carried by the multiple microphones in the room, is lost in the
process. For this reason when multiple microphones are available
(and therefore a beamforming is performed) the speaker location
information is reused for the speaker diarization module. Such
information comes from the Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA) values
between each microphone and the reference channel. Although
extensive research has gone into speaker localization using
multiple microphones (including the identification of each speaker
from the others), this is only possible when the topology and
exact location of all microphones is known in advance. This is not
considered in the current implementation of the system as multiple
room topologies are to be processed and, for some of them, the
microphones locations are not known.

<P>
Apart from the TDOA values, there are other features that could be
useful to determine the difference between speakers. One such
possibility is the relative amplitude between the different
channels, which should be able to identify whoever is closer to
what microphone, being therefore an indicator of location of the
speakers. This metric is though very correlated to the TDOA
values, suffering from the same problems, and therefore has not
been considered in this thesis. Further study should be done to
indicate wether using both information streams could lead to
further improved speaker diarization.
