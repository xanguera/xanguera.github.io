Possible Future Work Topics</A>
</H1>

<P>
As with everything else in life, there is more that could be done,
and it could not be otherwise in this thesis.

<P>
One topic within the meeting domain processing that has received
quite some attention recently is speaker overlap detection. As
such, it refers to the detection of the segments where more than
one speaker is talking at the same time, and the output of an
appropriate ID for each participant. In NIST RT06s evaluation the
main metric included overlap for the first time and multiple
research labs (including the author) researched techniques for its
detection without any success in reducing the overall error. There
is still work to be done in detecting when more than one person is
speaking, which should come from the beamforming module (where
speakers are well determined by their location) and from the
diarization module (where data with multiple overlapping speakers
has special acoustic properties compared to single speakers). Also
in ASR systems for meetings it would be very beneficiary to create
multiple signals in overlap regions, each one derived from the
steering to every speaker.

<P>
Another area where there research should be directed is the
creation of strong links between ASR transcription output and
diarization. Although it is well established the use of
diarization algorithms to help the ASR systems in model
adaptation, it has only been briefly studied the use of ASR for
diarization. It could be useful in a number of areas, like the
definition of possible speaker change-points (ranging from
boundaries at word level to discourse level), or in the assignment
of speaker ID's (or the correct name) based on the transcription
content (in which LIMSI has done some research). Also, both areas
could benefit by the combination of plausible speaker labels with
ASR N-best words for each instant, it being useful at decoding
level to reduce the errors in both the ASR and diarization tasks.

<P>
In the topic of discourse modeling, speaker diarization could
benefit from research on ways to model the turn-taking between the
speakers. By using information at a higher level than pure
acoustics, the transition probabilities between speakers could be
appropriately set to help the decoding. One of such possible high
level information is easily noticeable in broadcasted news where
an anchor speaker is very probable to speak after every other
speaker. Similar analysis could be made in the meetings domain and
possibly classify the meetings into several types (more fine
grained than the current lecture/conference classification) to
apply different models to. Possible types could me: moderated
meetings (with one person acting as anchor), structured meetings
(people following an order, without anchor) and unstructured
(where everyone intervenes at random, supposedly with higher
amount of overlap regions). Also, it could be considered to split
the meeting into several parts with each person's participation
dependent on which part/topic the meeting is in.

<P>
One of the objectives of this thesis was to increase the
robustness of the system to mismatches between the development
data and the test data, and to make the system parameters less
sensitive to the processed data by obtaining parameters more
linked to the acoustics and by eliminating any model training step
from the system. It has been shown in the experiments section that
an important step forward has been taken in that direction. There
is still more that can be done in this topic towards eliminating
as many tuning parameters as possible, letting the algorithms
select such parameters solely from the data. Also important is to
better understand the underlying processes that lead the system to
score very differently depending on every particular meeting
(leading to ``easy'' and ``difficult'' meetings).

<P>
Finally, although current systems in the RT evaluations are
defined with no application in mind, trying to be adaptable to any
possible application, this poses a burden in the capacity of such
systems to obtain the optimum score and makes them more
computationally intensive as most of the algorithms used for
diarization are iterative. It would be interesting to explore
particular areas of application where, for example, the number of
speakers in a meeting are known. This particular information would
probably change the way that speaker diarization algorithms are
designed and would allow for lower DER scores, most probably in
the region where speaker identification techniques are nowadays.
