Speech/non-Speech Detection and Parameters
Extraction</A>
</H2>

<P>
The use of a speech/non-speech detector in speaker diarization is
important to ensure that acoustic models for each of the clusters
correctly represents the speech data and is not ``contaminated''
by non-speech information. In the ICSI system each cluster is
initially modeled using a small number of Gaussian mixtures
(usually 5) given that they are trained using ML over a small
amount of data. This causes that the inclusion of non-speech data
into the training makes clusters resemble each other much more and
make the system prone to clustering errors, together with
non-speech errors.

<P>
The speech/non-speech detector for the BN system is a two-class
detector, in which each class is modeled by a three-state HMM,
with a minimum duration of 30 msec. The non-speech model includes
both music and silence. The features used in the SNS detector
(MFCC12) are different from the features used for clustering. This
detector that was initially used for ICSI-SRI’s BN STT system on
RT04f. It was trained on 80 hours of 1996 HUB4 BN acoustic data.
No tuning was made to adapt the detector to speaker diarization
for the RT04f evaluation.

<P>
In order to illustrate the advantages of using a speech/non-speech
(spnsp) detector (also sometimes referred as Speech Activity
Detection, SAD) in table <A HREF="#bn_spnsp">3.1</A> (taken from
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Wooters_2004">Wooters et&nbsp;al. (2004)</A>) diarization error rates are shown on
the RT04f data set using different kinds of spnsp detectors. The
Diarization Error Rate (DER) is the percentage of time that the
system miss-attributes speakers/non-speech segments. It can be
broken down into speaker errors, which accounts for
miss-attributed speaker segments, false alarms (FA) and missed
speech errors (MISS), which account for non-speech labelled as
speech, and viceversa. For an exhaustive definition of each on of
these types of error refer to section <A HREF="node107.html#eval_metrics">6.1.3</A>.

<P>
The first column shows the baseline system composed of the RT03f
system. It has an overall non-speech error of 5.1% and a speaker
error of 17.8%. By adding the speech/non-speech detector proposed
for broadcast news it not only improved the non-speech errors but
also reduces the speaker error, due to the reduction in clustering
errors as noted above. Finally, it is interesting to see how much
can be achieved in terms of DER if a perfect spnsp detector was
built. Such detector is obtained by extracting the speaker
segments from the reference segmentation and running the
diarization with those as spnsp input. It can be seen that the
proposed spnsp detector is still about 1.2% worse than the
perfect detector. The speaker error is lower in the proposed spnsp
detector than in the ideal one. This could indicate that some
non-speech data can still be beneficiary to train discriminant
speaker models. In this implementation the system obtained a 0.2%
and 0.1% MISS errors in the perfect spnsp and baseline systems
which was later reduced to 0%.

With respect to the parameters used in the system, as it happens
with other speech processing areas, acoustic modeling for speaker
diarization is performed based of acoustic features extracted from
the input signal. For the broadcast news system at ICSI the
features used have been modified over the years finally settling
down into the use of MFCC features with 19 coefficient, without
any deltas or double deltas and without the zeroth cepstral
coefficient, linked to the energy of the signal. For broadcast
news these features were computed over a 60 millisecond analysis
window in 20 milliseconds intervals. Multiple tests were done
resulting on the selection of these features. On one hand, the
increase in computation involved in using the delta and double
delta coefficients was considered unacceptable given that the
system gave mixed results when using them. On the other hand,
MFCC19 were chosen as opposed to PLP12, which were used on RT03f,
due to a slightly better performance when using them together with
the spnsp detector.

<P>
As can be seen in table <A HREF="#bn_params">3.2</A> also from
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Wooters_2004">Wooters et&nbsp;al. (2004)</A>, the baseline system using PLP and no
spnsp detector produces better overall results than the
counterpart MFCC system, but this second one is better when spnsp
is added. In the diarization system for meetings a possible
combination to use delays as features is proposed which is also
applicable to all other kinds of feature vectors.
