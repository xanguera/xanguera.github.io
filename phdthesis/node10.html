Acoustic Features for Speaker Diarization</A>
</H1>

<P>
Speaker diarization falls into the category of speaker-based
processing techniques. Features extracted from the acoustic signal
are intended to convey information about the speakers in the
conversations in order to enable the systems to separate them
optimally.

<P>
Like in speaker recognition and speech recognition systems, commonly
used parametrization features in speaker diarization are Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Linear frequency cepstral
coefficients (LFCC), Perceptual Linear Predictors (PLP), Linear
Predictive Coding (LPC) and others.

<P>
Although the aforementioned parametrization techniques yield a
good performance in current speaker diarization and recognition
systems, they are usually not focused on representing the
information relevant to distinguishing between speakers and to
isolate such information from other interfering sources (like
non-stationary noises, background music and others). Nevertheless
speaker recognition and diarization systems like the one presented
in this thesis use MFCC parameters with a higher number of
coefficients as it is known that the higher coefficients do
incorporate speaker information.

<P>
In this section some research is pointed out that propose
alternative parameters focusing on the speaker characteristics
and/or particular conditions of the tasks that they are applied
to, all within the speaker-based area, which can constitute an
advantage if used alone or in conjunction with the most common
parametrization techniques. Although the use of these parameters
is still not general, these should constitute the tip of the
iceberg of parameters exploiting speaker information to come.

<P>
In <A
 HREF="node147.html#Yamaguchi_2005">Yamaguchi et&nbsp;al. (2005)</A> propose a speaker segmentation system
using energy, pitch frequency, peak-frequency centroid and
peak-frequency bandwidth, and adds three new features: temporal
feature stability of the power spectra, spectral shape and white
noise similarities; all three related to the cross correlation of
the power spectrum of the signal.

<P>
In order to avoid the influence of background noises and other
non-speaker related events, in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Pelecanos_2001">Pelecanos and Sridharan (2001)</A> and more
recently in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Ouellet_2005">Ouellet et&nbsp;al. (2005)</A>, feature warping techniques
are proposed to change the shape of the p.d.f. (probability density
function) of the features to a Gaussian shape prior to their
modeling. They have been applied with success in
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Sinha_2005">Sinha et&nbsp;al. (2005)</A> and <A
 HREF="node147.html#Zhu_2006">Zhu et&nbsp;al. (2006)</A> for speaker
diarization in broadcast news and meetings respectively.

<P>
In the area of speech activity detection (SAD) there have been also
several features proposed in recent years. In
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Kristjansson_2005">Kristjansson et&nbsp;al. (2005)</A> some well known features and other
new ones are proposed, based on autocorrelation of the signal or on
the spectrum characteristics.

<P>
In <A
 HREF="node147.html#Nguyen_2003">Nguyen (2003)</A> a new theoretical framework for
natural isometric frontend parameters based on differential
geometry is presented and applied to speaker diarization,
improving performance when used in combination to standard MFCC
parameters.

<P>
In <A
 HREF="node147.html#Moh_2003">Moh et&nbsp;al. (2003)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Tsai_2004">Tsai et&nbsp;al. (2004)</A> and
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Tsai_2005">Tsai et&nbsp;al. (2005)</A> speaker diarization systems are proposed by
constructing a speaker space from the data and projecting the
feature vectors in it prior to the clustering step. Similarly,
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Collet_2005">Collet et&nbsp;al. (2005)</A> proposes the technique of anchor modeling
(introduced in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Sturim_2001">Sturim et&nbsp;al. (2001)</A>) where acoustic frames are
projected into an anchor model space (previously defined from
outside data) and perform speaker tracking with the resulting
parameter vectors. They show that it improves robustness against
outside interfering signals and they claim it to be domain
independent.

<P>
When more than one microphone is collecting the recordings (for
examples in meeting rooms) <A
 HREF="node147.html#Pardo_2006a">Pardo et&nbsp;al. (2006a)</A>,
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Pardo_2006b">Pardo et&nbsp;al. (2006b)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Ellis_01"><EM>ICSI Meeting Recorder Project: Channel skew in ICSI-recorded
  meetings</EM> (2006)</A>,
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Lathoud_2003">Lathoud and McCowan (2003)</A> show that the use of the time-delays
between microphones is useful for speaker diarization .

<P>
Finally, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Chan_2006">Chan et&nbsp;al. (2006)</A> propose the use of vocal source
features for the task of speaker segmentation using a system based
on <A
 HREF="node147.html#Delacourt_2000">Delacourt and Wellekens (2000)</A>. Also in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Lu_2002b">Lu and Zhang (2002b)</A> a
real-time 2-step algorithm is proposed by doing a Bayesian fusion of
LSP, MFCC and pitch features.
