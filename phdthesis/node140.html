Pros and Cons of the NIST Evaluations</A>
</H1>

<P>
I strongly believe in the advantages behind any evaluation where
different independent research groups work towards solving a
common problem. But as much as I think that they are beneficiary,
there are some issues that could be improved.

<P>
Participating in an evaluation campaign constitutes a wonderful
opportunity for a research group to get in touch with people that
work in the same topic of research, and therefore establish links
and collaborations afterwards in other projects or in following
evaluations. For example, in RT05s and RT06s the AMI team
participated in the Speech-to-text (STT) task with contributions
from multiple labs affiliated to the AMI project. Another good
example is the ELISA consortium, constituted by four labs located
in France which have shared expertise and built systems together
for speaker diarization for years.

<P>
It is also a good framework to be able to share resources between
research groups that allows for better systems to be created and
for more systems to be at the top performance possible. This was
the case in RT06s when Karlsruhe University shared the output of
their beamforming system in order allow other labs to obtain
results and perform research with the MM3A microphone array.

<P>
By participating in the evaluation campaigns it is beneficial for
researchers as it sets a deadline for the systems to be ready, and
allows a post-evaluation period when ``almost-done'' research can
be finished and presented at the evaluation workshop. This
although, can be seen as prejudicial for research groups involved
in too many overlapping evaluations and other projects.

<P>
One drawback of the current rich transcription evaluations is the
reduced number of participants in some of the tasks. This has been
tried to address by setting up smaller tasks like Speech Activity
Detection (SAD) in which many groups participated in RT06s.

<P>
By repeating the evaluations in successive years it allows
technology and new ideas brought in by one group to be used by
another with the purpose of solving/improving the problem at hand.
Baseline tools and systems should be made available to research
groups with a willingness to participate in order to allow them to
obtain competitive results without the need to building a whole
system.

<P>
