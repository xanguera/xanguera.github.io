Meetings Domain Overlap Regions</A>
</H3>

<P>
Given the analysis performed in the previous subsection, it was
found interesting to look at the overlap regions in more detail.
These are found with less frequency in the broadcast news data and
it only started being evaluated with the start of the meetings
domain evaluations. Nowadays overlap is considered an important
feature of the meeting data and therefore is included in the main
metric in the NIST RT evaluations. An analysis of the overlap was
performed for both forced-alignments and hand-alignments in the
conference room data, and it is shown in table
<A HREF="#overlap_conference">3.13</A>. In it, the average, maximum and standard
deviation segment length is computed for the overlap regions alone
and for the regions without any overlap.

<P>
From the average duration of the overlap regions one can see how
much difference in average length there is between both
transcription sources. The hand alignments are double the length
than the forced-alignments in average, probably due to the
difference in how the transcriptions are created. A human
transcriber upon listening to an overlap region might have
labelled it grossly, allowing for a few extra milliseconds in
either side. The forced-alignments are based on the uttered words,
which are tightly aligned by the ASR system. One drawback of the
forced-alignments on overlap regions comes when the transcribers
that wrote down the words miss the words or sounds existing in the
overlaps, and therefore the transcription is not aligned
correctly. Finally, on the overlap results, note that the values
on the hand-alignments have a much bigger standard deviation than
the automatically generate ones.

<P>
Regarding the analysis of values in the regions without any
overlap, the same observation as in the previous subsection can be
made. The average length of the speaker turns is bigger in the
hand-alignments, probably due to the consistent miss of small
silence regions, shown also by the values of the maximum segment
lengths.

<P>
To further analyze the duration of the overlaps, in figure
<A HREF="#overlap_histo">3.4</A> the histograms of the lengths of the overlap
segments in both forced-alignments and hand-alignments is shown.
As hinted by the averages, the peak of the forced-alignment
overlaps falls around 0.5 seconds, while the peak of the
hand-alignments is around 1 second and has a broader range of
bigger values than the forced-alignments.
