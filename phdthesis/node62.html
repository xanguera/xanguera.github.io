Speech/Non-Speech Algorithm
</H1>

<P>
In the broadcast news domain it was shown in
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Wooters_2004">Wooters et&nbsp;al. (2004)</A> that the speaker diarization performance
can be improved by the use of a speech/non-speech detector as a
first step to the agglomerative clustering process. The
speech/non-speech system used in this previous work was based on
acoustic models that needed to be trained on data as similar as
possible to the test data. This poses a robustness problem when
one intends to use the diarization system on ``unseen'' data, and
slows down the portability of the system to new environments,
where new training data needs to be labelled/located and new
speech/non-speech models need to be trained. For this purpose an
alternative was sought that would not require any training.

<P>
Among the systems that do not use acoustic models for
speech/non-speech detection, the most widely used, when non-speech
is considered mainly of a silence/noise nature, always include
energy as a feature. The performance of such systems is dependent
on setting appropriate thresholds which are typically tuned using
some development data. Tests done with the energy-based decoder,
that is part of the hybrid system presented below, showed that the
optimum threshold depends on the meeting acoustics and therefore
it should be tuned whenever data from a different source needed to
be processed, falling in the same trap as with model-based
detectors.

<P>
A novel system was designed and is presented in this thesis to
perform speech/non-speech detection, and its application to
speaker diarization in the meetings environment. Such system takes
advantage of the fact that most non-speech in meetings is silence.
It first performs an energy-based detection of the silence
portions in the input data using energy derivative filtering based
on <A
 HREF="node147.html#qili_2002">Li et&nbsp;al. (2002)</A>. This system only needs a coarse setting
of a threshold, which is then iteratively modified until
hypothesizing a reasonable number of silence segments. The second
stage of the system models speech and silence given the output
from the first stage by using GMM models, and creates a final
speech/non-speech segmentation to be used in the diarization
system. By running this two-stage system, it is avoided to use any
external training data to obtain an initial set of acoustic
models. From these initial models several iterations are performed
between segmenting the data and retraining the models to obtain
the final speech/non-speech segmentation.

<P>
The introduced hybrid system therefore attempts at solving some of
the problems from both model-based and energy-based
speech/non-speech detectors. On one hand, it is avoided to
accurate tune the energy threshold by using an iterative search of
a rough speech/non-speech segmentation used to initialize the
model-based decoder. On the other hand, by using such
initialization on the model-based decoder, it is avoided having to
train its models with pre-labelled data, resulting in a system
that is freed of the need for training data.

<P>
In the following sections both the energy-based decoder and the
model-based decoder used in the hybrid system are described.
Finally, the combination of both systems into the hybrid decoder
is explained.
