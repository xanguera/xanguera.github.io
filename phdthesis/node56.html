Acoustic Signal Enhancement</A>
</H2>

<P>
Both the individual channel enhancement block and the acoustic
fusion block aim at obtaining a signal with a better quality than
the original in order to improve the performance of the
diarization system.

<P>
The individual channels are first Wiener-filtered (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Wiener_49">Wiener and Norbert, 1949</A>)
to improve the SNR with the same algorithm as in the ICSI-SRI-UW
Meetings recognition system (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Mirghafori_04">Mirghafori et&nbsp;al., 2004</A>), which uses a
noise reduction algorithm developed for the Aurora 2 front-end,
proposed originally in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Adami_2002b">Adami, Burget, Dupont, Garudadri, Grezl, Hermansky, Jain,
  Kajarekar, Morgan and Sivadas (2002)</A>. The algorithm
performs Wiener filtering with typical engineering modifications,
such as a noise over-estimation factor, smoothing of the filter
response, and a spectral flooring. The original algorithm was
modified to use a single noise spectral estimate for each meeting
waveform. This was calculated over all the frames judged to be
non-speech by the voice-activity detection component within the
module. As observed in Figure <A HREF="node55.html#full_system">3.5</A>, the algorithm is
independently applied to each meeting channel and uses overlap-add
resynthesis to create noise-reduced output waveforms, which then
are either fed into the acoustic fusion block (multi-channel) or
directly into the segmentation and clustering block
(single-channel).

<P>
The acoustic fusion module makes use of standard beamforming
techniques in order to obtain an ``enhanced'' version of the
signal as a combination of the multiple channel input signals. It
considers the multiple channels to form a microphone array.
Neither the microphone positions nor their acoustic properties are
known. Given these constraints, a variation of the simple (yet
effective) delay&amp;sum beamforming technique is applied as it does
not require any information from the microphones in order to
operate. As the different microphones have a different acoustic
directivity pattern and are located in places in the room where
the noise level is different, a dynamic weighting of the
individual channels and a triangular filtering is used to reduce
its negative effects. By using such channel filtering the system
will be referred to as filter&amp;sum from now on.

<P>
The filter&amp;sum beamforming technique involves estimating the
relative time delay of arrival (TDOA) of the acoustic signal with
respect to a reference channel. The GCC-PHAT (Generalized Cross
Correlation with Phase Transform) is used to find the potential
relative delays regarding each of the speakers in the meeting. In
order to avoid impulsive noise, short-term events and overlap
speech from tainting the correct approximation of the TDOA,
multiple TDOA values are computed for each time and a double
post-processing algorithm is implemented to select the most
appropriate value. On one hand, noise is detected by measuring the
quality of the computed cross-correlation values at each point
with respect to the rest of the meeting and the computed TDOA
values are substituted by the previous (more reliable) values when
considered too low. On the other hand, impulsive events and
overlap is dealt with by using a double-step Viterbi decoding of
the delays in order to obtain the optimum set of TDOA values that
are both reliable and stable. A more in depth explanation of these
and other steps involved in the acoustic fusion block is given in
chapter <A HREF="node82.html#multich_process">5</A>.

<P>
Apart from using the post-processed estimated delays for the
filter&amp;sum beamforming, they are also used in the segmentation
and clustering block as they can convey information about the
speaker through his/her location in the room. Such information is
orthogonal to the acoustic information and therefore adds useful
information to the diarization system. In section
<A HREF="node100.html#multi_delays">5.3</A> the combination of both features is presented
in detail.
