ICSI Meetings Skew Estimation</A>
</H3>

<P>
This module was created to deal with all meetings that come from
the ICSI Meeting Corpus which have a error in the synchronization
of the channels. This was originally detected and reported in
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Ellis_01"><EM>ICSI Meeting Recorder Project: Channel skew in ICSI-recorded
  meetings</EM> (2006)</A>, indicating that the hardware used for the
recordings was found not to keep an exact synchronism between the
different acoustic channels, having a skew between channels of
multiples of 2.64ms. It is not possible to know beforehand the
amount of skew of each of the channels as they did not follow a
consistent ordering in their connections to the hardware being
used, therefore it is needed to automatically detect such skew for
it not to affect in the beamforming processing.

<P>
The artificially generated skew does not affect the general
processing of the channels by an ASR system as it does not need
exact time alignment between the channels (in terms of ms). It
does though pose a problem when computing the delays between
channels as it introduces an artificial delay between channel
pairs which forces to use a bigger analysis window for the ICSI
meetings than with other meetings in order to compute such delays
accurately, increasing the possibility of delay estimation error
and reducing the precision of such values. This module is
therefore used to estimate the skew between each channel and the
reference channel (in the case of ICSI meetings) and use it as a
constant bias in the rest of the delay computations from then on.

<P>
In order to estimate the bias a similar technique was used as when
estimating the reference channel and the weighting factor. Given
signal <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img381.png"
 ALT="$ x_{i}[n]$"></SPAN> to compute the skew for, the cross-correlation
is computed of it with the reference signal for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img382.png"
 ALT="$ P = 25$"></SPAN> blocks of
20 seconds each, evenly spaced along the recording. Such segment's
length has been determined in order to ensure that there is some
speech within the windows being compared. The average skew is
obtained for that channel by averaging the time delays of arrival
(TDOA) obtained for each of the segments when their
cross-correlation function is maximized. The process can be
summarized in:
