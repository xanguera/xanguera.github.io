Model Complexity Selection
</H3>

<P>
The acoustic models used to represent each cluster are a key part
of the agglomerative clustering process. On one hand, comparing
their likelihood given the data is how it is decided whether two
models belong to the same cluster or not. On the other hand, they
are used in the decoding process to redistribute the acoustic data
into the different clusters on every iteration.

<P>
When designing their size, an important decision is whether to use
fixed models (meaning a fixed number of Gaussian mixtures from
start to finish), or if it allows the number of Gaussian mixtures
to vary according to time or occupancy. Using fixed models is a
viable alternative, but runs into the problem of having sufficient
training data when the number of Gaussian mixtures is set to be
high, or being too general a model when it is set to be small.

<P>
Furthermore, when comparing two models via <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img92.png"
 ALT="$ \Delta$"></SPAN>BIC, if they
are too general they tend to over-merge, and when they are too
specific to the data they under-merge. Therefore it is important
to find a tradeoff on the number of mixtures used (model
complexity). This has been addressed in the systems presented by
ICSI to the RT evaluations for meetings and broadcast news
(<A
 HREF="node147.html#Anguera_2005">Anguera, Wooters, Peskin and Aguilo (2005)</A> and <A
 HREF="node147.html#Wooters_2004">Wooters et&nbsp;al. (2004)</A>) by using
variable complexities as the merging process progresses. In such
systems, all cluster models (regardless of their size) are
initially trained using a fixed number of Gaussian mixtures. Upon
merging any two clusters, the data from both original clusters are
merged and a new cluster model is created as the sum of both
parents' Gaussian mixtures.

<P>
Such an approach has a drawback that is addressed with the
proposed technique. Models with the same complexity are modeling
different amounts of data (sometimes very different), therefore
their focus is very different. When doing a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img92.png"
 ALT="$ \Delta$"></SPAN>BIC comparison
of such models one cannot expect to obtain coherent results,
therefore system performance can degrade.

<P>
An algorithm is presented that selects the number of mixtures to
be used when modeling each cluster according to its occupancy
count. This could be referred to as an <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">occupancy driven
approach</SPAN>. After each important change in the amount of data
assigned to each cluster (normally due to a segmentation step),
the number of acoustic frames that are assigned to each of the
models is used to determine the number of mixtures by:

 ALT="$ N_{i}^{j}$"></SPAN>) divided by a

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$ CCR_{gauss}$"></SPAN>) that is defined as Cluster
Complexity Ratio, fixed across all meetings.

<P>
In both approaches, the previous and this new one, the total
number of mixtures used over all models remains constant in
average, being distributed between the different cluster models as
described above. This allows tracking of the system evolution by
inspection of the Viterbi decoding total likelihood, which can be
compared across merging iterations.

<P>
The model complexity selection algorithm is executed in the places
described in Figure <A HREF="node57.html#diary_blocks">3.6</A>. The desired complexity of
each model is computed using the equation described above and when
it is different than the current complexity of the model it is
readjusted in one of two possible ways:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>When the final complexity is bigger than the current one,
the model is grown, one Gaussian at a time, as described in step 3
of section <A HREF="node58.html#speaker_clusters">3.3.3</A>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When the final complexity is smaller than the current one,
models are trained from scratch following the procedure in section
<A HREF="node58.html#speaker_clusters">3.3.3</A>. As it is explained in that section,
eliminating/vanishing Gaussian mixtures from small models is not
desirable and leads to a decrease in performance.
