Dual-Pass Viterbi Post-Processing
</H3>

<P>
The second post-processing technique applied to the computed
delays is used to select the appropriate delay to be used among
the M-best GCC-PHAT values are computed at each step. As pointed
out previously, the aim here is to maximize speaker continuity
avoiding constant delay switching in the case of multiple
speakers, and to filter out undesired steering towards spurious
noises present in the room.

<P>
As seen in figure <A HREF="#delaysum">5.5</A> a 2-level Viterbi decoding of the
M-best TDOA computed was applied. The first level consists of a
local individual-channel decoding where the 2-best delays are
chosen from the M-best delays computed for that channel at every
segment. The second level of decoding considers all combinations
of such 2-best across all channels and selects the final single
TDOA that ar more consistent across all. For each step one needs
to define the topology of the Viterbi algorithm and the emission
and transition probabilities to be used. The selection of a 2-step
algorithm is due in part to computational constraints as an
exhaustive search over all possible combinations of all M-best
values for all channels would easily become computationally
prohibitive.

<P>
Both steps choose the most probable (and second most probable)
sequence of hidden states where each item is related to the TDOA
values computed for one segment. In the first step the set of
possible states at each instant is given by the computed M-best
values. Each possible state has an emission probability for each
processed segment, equal to the GCC-PHAT value for each delay

<P>
This first Viterbi level aims at finding the best two TDOA values
that represent the meeting's speakers at any given time. By doing
so it is considered that the system will be able to choose the
most appropriate/stable TDOA for that segment and a secondary
delay, which can come from interfering events, other speakers or
the same speaker's echoes. Such TDOA values are any two (not
allowing the paths to collapse) of the M-best computed previously
by the system, and are chosen exclusively based on their distance
to surrounding TDOA values and their GCC-PHAT values.

On the other hand, the transition probabilities are also computed
in a similar way as in the first step, but in this case they
introduce a new dimension to the computation, as now a vector of
TDOA values needs to be taken into accound. As it was done with
the emission probabilities, the total distance is considered as
the sum of the individual distances from each element. Given

<P>
This second level of processing considers the relationship in
space present between all channels, as they are presumably
steering to the same point in space. By performing a decoding over
time it selects the TDOA vector elements according to their
distance to the vectors in its surroundings.

<P>
In both cases the transition probabilities are weighted to
emphasize its effect in the decision of the best path in the same
way as in the ASR systems (by product in the log domain). It will
be shown in the experiments section that a value of weight 25 for
both cases is what optimized the diarization error given the
development set.

<P>
To illustrate how the two-step Viterbi decoding works on the TDOA
values let us consider figure <A HREF="#double_Viterbi">5.6</A>. It shows a
situation where four microphones are used in a room where two
speakers are talking to each other, with some overlap speech.
There is also one or more noisy events of short duration and noise
room in general, both represented by a ``noise'' source. Given one
of the microphones as a reference, the delay to each of the other
microphone is computed, resulting in delays from speech coming
from either speaker (<!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

For a particular segment the M-best TDOA values from the GCC-PHAT
cross correlation function are computed. The first Viterbi step
determines for each individual channel the 2-best paths across
time for all the meeting. Figure <A HREF="#Viterbi_pass1">5.7</A> shows a
possible Viterbi trellis for the first step for channel 1, where
each column represents the M-best TDOA values computed for one
segment. In this example four segments were considered where two
speakers are overlapping each other, and there is also some
eventual noisy events. For any given segment the Viterbi algorithm
finds the two-best paths (forced not to overlap with each other)
according to their distance of the delays to the chosen delays in
the neighboring segments (transition probability) and to their
cross-correlation values (emission probability). The resulting
paths could be:

<P>
The third computed segment contains a noisy event that is well
detected by channel 1 and the reference channel, and therefore it
appears as the first in the M-best computed TDOA list. The effect
of the Viterbi decoding can avoid selecting this event as its
delay differs too much from the best delays in its surroundings
and both speakers also appear with high correlation. On the other
hand, the first and second segments contain the delays referring
to the true speakers in the first and second-best positions,
although alternated in both segments. This example illustrates a
possible case where they cannot be correctly ordered and therefore
there is a quick speaker change in the first and second-best delay
paths in that segment.

<P>
The second step Viterbi decoding is intended to add an extra layer
of robustness for the selection of the appropriate delays by
considering all the possible delay combinations from all channels.
Figure <A HREF="#Viterbi_pass2">5.8</A> shows the trellis formed by considering
for each segment (in columns) all possible combinations of m-best
delays (<!-- MATH
 $\textbf{g}_{n}^{i}[c]$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

<P>
In this step only the best path is selected according to the
overall combined distances and correlation values among all
possible combinations. In this example the algorithm is able to
solve the order mismatch from the previous step, selecting the
delays relative to speaker 1 for all the segments. The current
computes the 2-best path also in this step and output a signal
steering at the two sets of TDOA values, although the diarization
algorithm only use the first of them. In order to take advantage
of the second (or more) delays steering at the overlap speakers in
the meeting it is necessary to achieve some more progress in
reliable speaker overlap detection algorithms, which remains as
future work at the end of this thesis.

<P>
In the implementation of the second level Viterbi decoding a big
burden in computation time could be faced depending on the amount
of microphones to be processed. In the second level Viterbi the

 ALT="$ N&gt;5$"></SPAN> the pool of microphones are split is
blocks of 5 and the Viterbi is computed in each block
independently. This is a suboptimal solution as not all
microphones are used to optimize the delays and therefore it is
not certain that all blocks will converge to the same solution. It
is though much faster in processing time and it was not observed
to degrade the overall performance compared to using all
microphones together.

<P>
In conclusion, this newly-introduced double-Viterbi technique aims
at finding a good tradeoff between reliability (cross-correlation)
and stability (distance between contiguous delays). The second is
cherished the most as the aim is to obtain an optimally improved
signal, avoiding quick changes of the beamforming between acoustic
events.
