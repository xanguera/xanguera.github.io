Speaker Diarization</A>
</H1>

<P>
In some occasions the use of the term speaker diarization is
confused with speaker clustering. One must refer as speaker
clustering the techniques and algorithms that agglutinate together
all segments that belong to the same speaker. This does not entail
wether such segments come from the same acoustic file or different
ones. It also does not say anything about how acoustically
homogeneous segments within a single file are obtained. The term
speaker diarization refers to the systems that perform a speaker
segmentation of the input signal and then a speaker clustering of
the created segments into homogeneous groups (or some hybrid
mechanism doing both at the same time), all within the same file
or input stream.

<P>
In the literature one can normally find two main applications for
speaker diarization. On one hand, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems make use of the speaker homogeneous clusters to
adapt the acoustic models to be speaker dependent and therefore
increase recognition performance. On the other hand, speaker
indexing and rich transcription systems use the speaker
diarization output as one of (possibly) many information pieces
extracted from a recording, which allow its automatic indexation
and other further processing areas.

<P>
This section reviews the main systems present in the literature
for both applications. It mainly focuses on systems that propose
solutions to a blind speaker diarization problem, where no
information is known a priori about the number of people or their
identities. On one hand, it is crucial for systems oriented
towards rich transcription of the data to accurately estimate the
number of speakers present, as error measures penalize any
incorrectly assigned speaker segment. On the other hand, in ASR
systems it becomes more important to have sufficient data to
accurately adapt the resulting speaker models, therefore several
speakers with similar acoustic characteristics are preferably
grouped together.

<P>
At a high level point of view one can differentiate between online
and offline systems. The systems that process the data offline
have access to all the recording before they start processing it.
These are the most common in the bibliography and they are the
main focus of attention of this review. The online systems only
have access to the data that has been recorded up to that point.
They might allow a latency in output to allow for a certain amount
of data to become available for processing, but in any case no
information on the complete recording is available. Such systems
usually start with one single speaker (whoever starts talking at
the beginning of the recording) and iteratively increase the
number of speaker as they intervene. The following are some
representative systems used for online processing:

<P>
In <A
 HREF="node147.html#Mori_2001">Mori and Nakagawa (2001)</A> a clustering algorithm based on the
Vector Quantization (VQ) distortion measure (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Nakagawa_1993">Nakagawa and Suzuki, 1993</A>)
is proposed. It starts processing with one speaker in the
code-book and incrementally adds new speakers whose VQ distortion
exceeds a threshold in the current code-book.

<P>
In <A
 HREF="node147.html#Rougui_2006">Rougui et&nbsp;al. (2006)</A> a GMM based system is proposed, using
a modified KL distance between models. Change points are detected
as the speech becomes available and data is assigned to either
speaker present in the database or a new speaker is created,
according to a dynamic threshold. Emphasis is put into fast
classification of the speech segments into speakers by using a
decision tree structure for speaker models.

<P>
All systems presented below are based on offline processing,
although some of the techniques presented could potentially be
used also in an online implementation.  These systems can be
classified in two main groups, on one hand the hierarchical
clustering techniques reach the optimum diarization by iterative
processing of different number of possible clusters obtained by
merging or splitting existing clusters. On the other hand, other
clustering techniques first estimate the number of clusters and
obtain a diarization output without deriving the clusters from
bigger/smaller ones.
