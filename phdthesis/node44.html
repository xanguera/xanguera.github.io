Clusters Initialization and Acoustic Modeling
</H2>

<P>
The system implemented at ICSI for broadcast news is based on an
agglomerative clustering process that iteratively merges clusters
until getting to the optimum number of clusters. In order to
initialize the system one needs to obtain an initial set of
clusters <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="$ K$"></SPAN> (where <!-- MATH
 $K > K_{opt}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img166.png"
 ALT="$ K &gt; K_{opt}$"></SPAN>, the optimum number of clusters
representing the number of speakers in the recording). During the
implementation of the original system two alternatives were
considered, on one hand, a k-means algorithm was tested in order
to split the data into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="$ K$"></SPAN> clusters containing homogeneous frames.
Another alternative was to split the data into even sized pieces.
The second was finally selected due to its simplicity and the good
results that it achieved on most data.

<P>
The linear initialization of the data into clusters is a simple
algorithm that clusters the data according to its temporal
proximity rather than acoustic proximity, allowing for models to
be trained with acoustic data of very different acoustic
characteristics that belongs to the same speaker.

<P>
In order to create <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="$ K$"></SPAN> clusters the clusters initialization
algorithm first splits the show into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img63.png"
 ALT="$ P$"></SPAN> partitions (where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img167.png"
 ALT="$ P=2$"></SPAN>
for Broadcast news). Then for each partition the data is split
into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="$ K$"></SPAN> segments of the same size and labelled <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="55" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img168.png"
 ALT="$ 1 \dots K$"></SPAN>. The
initial data for cluster <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img73.png"
 ALT="$ k$"></SPAN> (where <!-- MATH
 $k \epsilon 1 \dots K$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img169.png"
 ALT="$ k \epsilon 1 \dots K$"></SPAN>) is the
union of the data labelled <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img73.png"
 ALT="$ k$"></SPAN> for each of the partitions. This
technique is thought to work better than a more elaborate
frame-level k-means algorithm because it takes into account the
possible acoustic variation of the speech belonging to a single
speaker. By clustering the data with k-means one cannot ensure
that the resulting clusters contain frames from the same speaker,
but maybe it contains acoustic frames that belong to the same
phonetic class from several speaker.

<P>
Each initial cluster obtained via linear initialization it will
most certainly have data belonging to more than one
source/speaker. In order for the clusters to achieve some speaker
homogeneity before stating the merging iterations the algorithm
performs three iterations of models training and Viterbi
segmentation of the data. Next section goes into more detail how
clusters are modeled. The resulting clusters tend to contain data
from a single speaker or at least a majority of it.

<P>
There are some occasions when using linear initialization that it
creates clusters with acoustic segments from more than one
speaker, causing them potential merging errors and therefore a
decrease in performance. In the improvements for the meetings room
data a new initialization algorithm and a segment purification
algorithm, that detects and splits such clusters, will be
proposed.

<P>
The broadcast news clustering algorithm models the acoustic data
using an ergodic hidden Markov model (HMM) topology, as seen in
figure <A HREF="#bn_topology">3.2</A>, where each initial state corresponds to
one of the initial clusters. Upon completion of the algorithm's
execution, each remaining state is considered to represent a
different speaker. Each state contains a set of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img171.png"
 ALT="$ M\_D$"></SPAN> sub-states,
imposing a minimum duration of staying in any model. Each one of
the sub-states has a probability density function modeled via a
Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The same GMM model is tied to all
sub-states in any given state. Upon entering a state at time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img91.png"
 ALT="$ n$"></SPAN>,
the model forces a jump to the following sub-state with
probability <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img172.png"
 ALT="$ 1.0$"></SPAN> until the last sub-state is reached. In that
sub-state, we can remain in the same sub-state with transition
weight <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img65.png"
 ALT="$ \alpha$"></SPAN>, or jump to the first sub-state of another state
with weight <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img173.png"
 ALT="$ \beta/M$"></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img33.png"
 ALT="$ M$"></SPAN> is the number of active
states/clusters at that time. The diarization system for broadcast
news used values <!-- MATH
 $\alpha=0.9$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="61" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img174.png"
 ALT="$ \alpha=0.9$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="61" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img175.png"
 ALT="$ \beta=0.1$"></SPAN> with the intention
of favoring the system to stay in the same cluster and therefore
model speaker turns bigger than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img171.png"
 ALT="$ M\_D$"></SPAN> frames. As will be shown,
this implicitly models the maximum length for a speaker term. In
the meetings system it is modified to reduce such constraint.

<P>
Each of the GMM models initially has a complexity of 5 Gaussian
mixtures, which was optimized using development data from previous
evaluations. Upon deciding that two clusters belong to the same
speaker, one of the clusters/models is eliminated from the HMM
topology, M is reduced by 1 and the resulting model is trained
from scratch with a complexity being the sum of the previous two
models. This ensures that the complexity of the overall system
after any particular iteration remains constant and therefore the
overall likelihood of the data given the overall HMM model can be
compared between iterations.
