<P>
In the previous section a majority of the algorithms proposed in
this thesis for use in speaker diarization have been analyzed,
first by themselves comparing them to the baseline and then as
part of an agglomerate system in order to obtain an optimum final
system.

Table <A HREF="#summary_results_agglo">6.23</A> shows a summary of the results
analyzed in the previous section and computes the relative
improvement of each algorithm with respect to the previous one and
to the baseline (accumulating all improvements). Both the
friends-and-enemies and segment purification algorithms obtain bad
results in this experiment and therefore are not included in the
agglomerate system result (results with * indicate that the
relative improvement to the prior system computes it not taking
them into account). The algorithms not included in this final
experiment are still valid and obtain good results in certain
situations, but not in the average of all cases.

<P>
Taking into account the average DER between the SDM, MDM and
TDOA-MDM system outputs, and tuning all the algorithms to them,
the proposed algorithms in the diarization module improve up to a
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">10.36</SPAN>% relative in the development set and up to a
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">13.21</SPAN>% relative in the evaluation set.

<P>
While such approach of optimizing the average DER obtains systems
that will perform well for all the different tasks considered. In
some applications where multiple microphones are available it is
interesting to find the best result possible. To obtain it the
TDOA-MDM system has been selected and the parameters optimized to
it according to the parameter sweeps performed in the previous
section. The parameters selection was then:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Automatic multi-stream weighting

<LI>model complexity selection and number of initial clusters

<P>
The obtained results are shown in table <A HREF="#best_tdoa-mdm">6.24</A> where
DER results are shown only for the TDOA-MDM task, which is usually
the one with best performance. By using the optimum parameters
according to the development sweeps in the previous section, and
including all algorithms into the system, the resulting optimum
TDOA-MDM system obtains an improvement of 5.08% on the evaluation
set versus the optimum average system optimized for the average
DER for all three systems.

<P>
The final system has a robust performance over changes in the
data, sometimes at the cost of not obtaining the absolute minimum
DER in all cases. To illustrate this, let us take the system
labelled as best TDOA-MDM on the development, which is a system
built only using the automatic weighting algorithm and the
definition of number of clusters and complexity of the models.
This system outperforms vastly the optimum systems in the
development set but when changing to a different set it returns a
poor performance. By using the optimum systems once all algorithms
are in place, the results are even in both sets at the expense of
some increase int the DER in the development.

<P>
Table <A HREF="#final_phd_scores">6.25</A> shows the DER scores to illustrate
the overall improvement achieved by the system while transforming
from broadcast news speaker diarization to diarization for
meetings. The BN baseline system shows the DER of the described
baseline which uses model-based speech/non-speech detection. As
pointed out, even though this system is already a step forward
from the system at the start of this thesis work, it acts as a
good baseline for all the work done in beamforming and speaker
diarization.

<P>
The meetings baseline is the same baseline as in the BN system,
but using the hybrid speech/non-speech detection and the baseline
RT06s beamforming. Finally, the optimum TDOA-MDM system has been
presented earlier in this section and shows the optimum/robust
results obtained by using all proposed algorithms.

<P>
The optimum TDOA-MDM system obtains an outstanding 41.15%
relative improvement on the development set compared to the BN
baseline, and a 25.45% relative improvement on the evaluation
set. As shown over the experiment sections, these improvements are
due to all the new and refurbished algorithms proposed for the
system, being the MDM beamforming and the inclusion of TDOA
features into the diarization the two most outstanding components.

<P>
One Interesting result in the BN baseline system is the
outstanding difference between development and evaluation results.
While the system performs rather poorly on the development set,
for that particular combination of parameters it obtains a very
good result on the evaluation set. Running any acoustic
beamforming using more microphones than just the SDM results
always in an increase on the DER. In fact, an experiment using the
RT06s beamforming on top of the BN baseline achieves a 23.63% DER
on dev set (a slight improvement) and 26.3% DER on the evaluation
set (much worse, similar to the result for the meetings baseline).

<P>
This is another example of show flakiness and lack of robustness
on the baseline system. On one hand, while one set of data
performs well, another set can perform very poorly for the same
parameters setting. On the other hand, when doing changes to the
system, not all datasets perform the same way, achieving an
improvement on one set does not mean that it translates to others.
This problem is the keystone of research in speaker diarization
and has been a main concern and issue during all the thesis
development, as random results jeopardize the assessment of new
techniques that, although beneficiary to the system, might have
been discarded due to poor performance.

<P>
Given each independent recording (meetings, broadcast news or
other sources), the speaker diarization algorithm processes it and
obtains an output segmentation. Such segmentation might show a
slight improvement due to the applied systems but could also
obtain a very high DER due to factors like a badly chosen stopping
point. By considering the final DER as the time-weighted sum of
all excerpts, if a few of them experienced such bad behavior then
the final score is worse than previous runs, misleading to
thinking that the tested algorithm is not correct. When computing
the DER for a small set of excerpts (8 to 10), these errors cause
a big impact in the final score.

<P>
While the DER score is a standard way of measuring diarization
performance as used in the NIST RT evaluations, which is the
ultimate metric to reduce to show improvements in the systems, in
order to avoid the problems posed earlier there are several
alternatives. On one hand the use of bigger development and
evaluation sets so as to reduce the effect of these outliers. To
work with such datasets there must be accurate and consistent
transcriptions to test against, which should be obtained using
automated mechanisms like forced-alignments. On the other hand,
the DER metric could be altered to eliminate the outlier scores
from the average during development. Although this would solve the
occasional excerpts with big errors, it does not help improve
those that are considered ``hard nuts'' (shows that always perform
very badly) and it is therefore difficult to define the outlier
boundaries that describe the system correctly.

comparison only as development using these references was stopped
and switched to the forced-alignment references, much more robust
