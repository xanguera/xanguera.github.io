Friends-and-Enemies Initialization
</H2>

<P>
In this section a new cluster initialization algorithm is
presented (see <A
 HREF="node147.html#Anguera_2006d">Anguera, Wooters and Hernando (2006c)</A>), which has been called
``friends-and-enemies'' initialization due to the way that
single-speaker segments are grouped with those closer to them, and
new clusters are created as enemies of the existing clusters. A
cross-likelihood metric is used to determine ``friendliness''.
This algorithm is aimed at improving the prior linear
initialization algorithm, explained in section
<A HREF="node44.html#linear_initialization">3.1.2</A>.

<P>
The clusters initialization block has often been considered to be
of less importance in the past, as many segmentations and models
retraining iterations take place later in the process that should
allow any ``pseudo-optimal'' initializations to perform as well as
any other in the end. In this respect it has been considered that
the best initialization is that which does not introduce any
computational burden to the overall system.

<P>
With a marked reduction of the error in the current system, it has
been seen that the linear initialization <SPAN  CLASS="textit">does</SPAN> cause a
problem on the final score, since some initial clustering errors
are propagated all the way to the end of the agglomerative
clustering and show up in the final result. It has also been
observed that a linear initialization without any acoustic
constraints on the initially created clusters introduces a random
effect in the system which could be one of the sources of per-show
``flakiness'', as presented in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Mirghafori_2006">Mirghafori and Wooters (2006)</A>.

<P>
When designing an initialization algorithm for speaker diarization
there is an additional problem beyond the standard problem of
acoustic clustering. It is important to constrain the
classification of every acoustic frame according to its context,
in the same way as it will be classified within the rest of the
system, which uses a minimum duration for a speaker turn to avoid
instabilities and very short segments. For this reason it is
important to separate into two different initial clusters, for
example, data from a speaker in a solo presentation and data from
the same speaker in an overlap region, or in a region with a lot
of non-detected silence segments as the models used initially are
small and can cause problems when modeling different kinds of
data. These clusters should be merged in the agglomerative
clustering, using more complex models.

<P>
The proposed ``friends-and-enemies'' initialization algorithm aims
at creating <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img194.png"
 ALT="$ K_{init}$"></SPAN> initial clusters ensuring that each cluster
contains data only from one speaker. It intends to maximize the
cluster purity, as introduced in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Gauvain_1998">Gauvain et&nbsp;al. (1998)</A>, which
accounts for the percentage of frames in any given cluster that
come from the most represented speaker in that cluster. It differs
from the DER in that it does not pretend to find the optimum
number of clusters, but rather obtain each cluster with only one
speaker worth of data in it.
