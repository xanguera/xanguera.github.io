The ICSI Broadcast News System
</H1>

<P>
The broadcast news (BN) system currently used at ICSI and which
has been used as a base for the meetings system, was originally
created by Jitendra Ajmera circa 2003. He built the system while
he was a PhD student at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) and IDIAP
(Martigny, Switzerland) and implemented it at ICSI while visiting
for 6 months. During Ajmera's stay, ICSI participated in the NIST
2003 Rich transcription of broadcast news spring evaluation with
the developed system, and soon afterwards in the RT03f (``who
spoke the words'' evaluation). The diarization system was then
improved and ICSI participated again in the RT04f evaluation
(<A
 HREF="node147.html#Wooters_2004">Wooters et&nbsp;al., 2004</A>), also in broadcast news.

<P>
The system is a bottom-up agglomerative clustering approach that
uses a modified version of the BIC distance (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Ajmera_2003a">Ajmera et&nbsp;al., 2003</A>) in
order to iteratively merge the closest clusters until the same BIC
distance determines the system to stop. Speaker segmentation of
the data is not done explicitly before the clustering part, but it
is done via Viterbi decoding of the data given the current speaker
models at every iteration. For a thorough description of the
system refer to <A
 HREF="node147.html#Ajmera_2004">Ajmera (2004)</A>.

<P>
The philosophy behind the system and all research that has been
done towards implementation of the meetings system is based on
these key concepts:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Make the system as robust as possible to data within the
same domain which the system has not been adapted to.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow for a fast adaptation of the system to use it in new
domains (i.e. broadcast news, meetings, telephone speech, and
others).

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
These key concepts were put into practice by imposing
the following guidelines:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Use as few training data as possible so that the system can
be easily adapted to new domains and is not over-tuned to the data
it is trained on.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Avoid as much as possible the use of thresholds and tuning
parameters. If not possible, try to define parameters that once
tuned can achieve good performance in different kinds of data.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The implementation of the broadcast news system used as a baseline
for the meetings domain was presented to the RT04f broadcast news
evaluation (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Wooters_2004">Wooters et&nbsp;al., 2004</A>), which is the latest broadcast news
evaluation conducted by NIST within the EARS (Effective Affordable
Reusable Speech-to-Text) program. It differs from the original
diarization system created by Ajmera (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Ajmera_2003b">Ajmera and Wooters, 2003</A>) in four
main points. First the inclusion of a speech/non-speech detector
to filter out the non-speech segments prior to doing any further
processing to the data and the discontinuation of use of a
speech/music classifier used in the RT03s evaluation. Also, the
parameterization used was MFCC, instead of PLP used until then.
Finally, the inclusion of am iterative segmentation-training loop
in the algorithm to allow models to converge to the clusters data.

<P>
It can be seen in figure <A HREF="#bn_blocks">3.1</A> the main blocks
constituting the system. In the following sections a detailed
description of the different blocks is given.
