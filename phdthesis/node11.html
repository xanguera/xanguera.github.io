Speaker Segmentation
</H1>

<P>
Speaker segmentation has sometimes been referred to as speaker
change detection and is closely related to acoustic change
detection. For a given speech/audio stream, speaker segmentation/
change detection systems find the times when there is a change of
speaker in the audio. On a more general level, acoustic change
detection aims at finding the times when there is a change in the
acoustics in the recording, which includes speech/non-speech,
music/speech and others. Acoustic change detection can detect
boundaries within a speaker turn when the background conditions
change.

<P>
Although erroneously, the  term ``speaker segmentation'' has
sometimes been used instead of speaker diarization for systems
performing both a segmentation into different speaker segments and a
clustering of such segments into homogeneous groups. As it will be
pointed out later on, many systems obtain a speaker diarization
output by means of first performing a speaker segmentation and then
grouping the segments belonging to the same speaker. Other times
this distinction is not so clear as segmentation and clustering are
mixed together. In this thesis a system will be said to perform
speaker segmentation when all frames, assigned to any particular
speaker ID, are contiguous in time. Otherwise the system will be
said to perform speaker segmentation and clustering (or equivalently
speaker diarization).

<P>
On a very general level, two main types of speaker segmentation
systems can be found in the bibliography. The first kind are systems
that perform a single processing pass of the acoustic data, from
where the change-points are obtained. A second broad class of
systems are those that perform multiple passes, refining the
decision of change-point detection on successive iterations. This
second class of systems include two-pass algorithms where in a first
pass many change-points are suggested (more than there actually are,
therefore with a high false alarm error rate) and in a second pass
such changes are reevaluated and some are discarded. Also part of
the second broad class of systems are those that use an iterative
processing of some sort to converge into an optimum speaker
segmentation output. Many of the algorithms to find the
change-points reviewed in this section (including all of the
metric-based techniques) can either work alone or in a two-step
system together with another technique.

<P>
On another level, a general classification of the methods
available for speaker segmentation will be used in this section to
describe the different algorithms available. In the bibliography
(<A
 HREF="node147.html#Ajmera_2004">Ajmera (2004)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Kemp_2000">Kemp et&nbsp;al. (2000)</A>,

 HREF="node147.html#Chen_2002">Chen et&nbsp;al. (2002)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Chen_1998a">Shaobing&nbsp;Chen and Gopalakrishnan (1998)</A>,
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Perez-Freire_2004">Perez-Freire and Garcia-Mateo (2004)</A>) three groups are defined:
metric-based, silence-based and model-based algorithms. In this
thesis this classification will be augmented with a fourth group
(called ``others'') to amalgamate all other techniques that do not
fit any of the three proposed classes. In the next section the
metric-based techniques are reviewed in detail and in
<A HREF="node13.html#other_segmentations">2.2.2</A> the other three groups are treated.
