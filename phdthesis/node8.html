Outline of the Thesis
</H1>

<P>
This thesis is split into seven main chapters on the topic of
robust speaker diarization for meetings. A brief description
follows of what is to be found in each chapter.

<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node9.html#state_art">2</A> takes a look into the proposed problem: how
to robustly and optimally determine ``Who spoke when?'' in a meeting
domain where multiple microphones are usually available for
recording. In order to address it, a review of what features have
been previously used in speaker-related problems is followed by an
analysis of the state of the art in speaker segmentation, which
plays an important part in many speaker diarization algorithms. Then
a review of previously proposed diarization algorithms and
implementations sets the ground for a description of the projects,
databases and systems that, to the date, have had their main focus
in the meetings domain. Finally, and given the multichannel nature
of a meeting room, acoustic enhancement theory is introduced to
process multiple microphones, and the main techniques are reviewed
for the purpose of obtaining a single ``enhanced'' channel from
multiple inputs.

<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node41.html#system_intro">3</A> leads the reader through the system
implementation, basing it in the diarization system that existed for
broadcast news prior to this thesis work. An initial review of the
ideas behind the system and the implementation of the broadcast news
speaker diarization system is followed by an analysis of the
differences and needs in order to adapt it to the meetings domain.
Finally, a description of the meetings implementation in comparison
to the prior system is pursued. Each of the blocks and algorithms
that have been reused, refurbished or created from scratch for the
meetings domain are introduced, while leaving for later chapters the
description in detail of the novel algorithms presented in this
thesis.

<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node61.html#acoustic_modeling">4</A> describes in detail all the novel
techniques introduced in this thesis for the processing of single
channel acoustic data. These include a new speech/non-speech
decoder which improves the previous version by being totally
train-free and more adapted to the diarization process. Also,
several algorithms for speaker clusters description and modeling,
including algorithms for description of the  number of clusters,
model complexity selection, a new training algorithm and two
cluster purification algorithms.

<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node82.html#multich_process">5</A> describes in detail the particular
characteristics of using multiple channels in a meeting room and
how the diarization processing can benefit from them. A
filter&amp;sum beamforming algorithm is selected for the task. The
algorithm basic description and its implementation is described,
explaining both well known and novel algorithms used for it. Also
in this chapter a description of the use of the Time Delay of
Arrival (TDOA) between channels as a parallel feature stream for
the diarization module is pursued. Finally, a novel algorithm for
the weight determination between TDOA and acoustic features is
described.

<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node103.html#experiments">6</A> describes the experiments to show the
appropriateness of all techniques. First, it describes the setup
for running the experiments and then shows and explains the
results for each one, comparing it to a baseline derived from the
original broadcast news system prior to this thesis work or from
intermediate (well established) points.

<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node128.html#nist_evals">7</A> describes the content and motivations
behind the NIST Rich Transcription evaluations, which has been the
tool used to assess the quality and to compare the proposed
diarization system to other research systems and is the source of
all datasets used in the experiments. A description of ICSI's
submissions for 2005 and 2006 is explained in detail and results
for those evaluations are given.

<P>
Finally, chapter <A HREF="node141.html#conclusions">8</A> summarizes the major
contributions and results obtained in this thesis and proposes
some improvements and future work.
