Microphone Array Beamforming
</H2>

<P>
The application of the general signal beamforming theory to the
case of acoustic beamforming has some peculiarities and has been
broadly studied in the past. In general it is considered that the
acoustic signal is generated by a far-field source (therefore it
arrives at the microphones as a flat wave) and that it has usually
been considered as having a narrow-band frequency response (not
taking into consideration the different behavior of the arrays to
multiple frequencies).

<P>
There are two main groups of beamforming techniques that can be
found in the bibliography. These are data-independent (or fixed)
and data-dependent (or adaptive). The techniques that are
data-independent fix their parameters and maintain them throughout
the processing of the input signal. Data dependent techniques
update their parameters to better suit the input signal, adapting
to changing noise conditions. Moreover, there are several
postprocessing techniques that are applied after the beamforming,
some of them very linked to the beamforming process.

<P>
Fixed beamforming techniques are simpler to implement than the
adaptive ones, but are more limited in their ability to eliminate
highly directive (and sometimes changing) noise sources. The
simplest beamforming technique in this group is the delay&amp;Sum
(D&amp;S) technique (<A

technique all channels are equally weighted at the output. The
D&amp;S beamforming is a particular case of a more general definition
of a filter&amp;sum beamforming where an independent filter is
applied to each channel:

<P>
One application of such techniques is the Superdirective
Beamforming (SDB) (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Cox_86">Cox et&nbsp;al. (1986)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Cox_87">Cox et&nbsp;al. (1987)</A>),
where the channel filters (or also called superdirective
beamformers) are defined to maximize the array gain (or
directivity factor), which is defined as the improvement in signal
to noise ratio between the reference channel and the ``enhanced''
system output.

<P>
For the case of near-field signals (like when a microphone array
is located right in front of the speaker in a workstation) the SDB
has been reformulated (<A
 HREF="node147.html#Tager_98">Tager (1998a)</A>,
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Tager_98b">Tager (1998b)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#McCowan_00b">McCowan, Moore and Sridharan (2000)</A>) by using the
near-field propagation functions for the acoustic waves, where
waves are not considered planar anymore.

<P>
Considering the speech signal to be narrow-band simplifies the
design of beamforming systems but does not represent well the
reality. To deal with broadband signals in an effective manner,
several sub-array beamforming techniques have been proposed
(<A
 HREF="node147.html#Fischer_97">Fischer and Kammeyer (1997)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Sanchez_03">Sanchez-Bote et&nbsp;al. (2003)</A>) where the set
of microphones is split into several sub-arrays which focus their
processing in a particular band, collapsing all the information
into the ``enhanced'' signal at the end.

<P>
The adaptive beamforming techniques present a higher capacity at
reducing noise interference but are much more sensitive to
steering errors due to the approximation of the channel delays.

<P>
The Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC) technique
(<A
 HREF="node147.html#Griffiths_82">Griffiths and Jim, 1982</A>) aims at enhancing the signal that comes from
the desired direction while cancelling out signals coming from
other sources. This is achieved by creating a double path for the
signal in the algorithm. A standard beamforming path is modified
by an adaptive path consisting of a blocking matrix and a set of
adaptive filters that aim at minimizing the output noise power.
The blocking matrix blocks the desired signal from the second
path. At the end both paths are subtracted to obtain the output
signal. In order to find the optimum coefficients for the lower
part, an algorithms like the Least Mean Squares (LMS) can be used.

<P>
Although widely used, in practice the GSC can suffer from
distortion of the output signal normally called signal leakage.
This is due to the inability of the blocking matrix to completely
eliminate the desired signal from the adaptive path (which is very
common in speech due to its broadband properties). This problem is
treated in <A
 HREF="node147.html#Hoshuyama_99">Hoshuyama et&nbsp;al. (1999)</A> where the blocking matrix is
designed with control of the allowed target error region.

<P>
A different kind of adaptive beamforming techniques are those that
allow a small amount of distortion of the desired signal as it is
considered not to affect the quality of the signal as perceived by
human ears. One of such techniques is named the AMNOR (Adaptive
Microphone-array system for Noise Reduction), introduced by
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Kaneda_86">Kaneda and Ohga (1986)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Kaneda_91">Kaneda (1991)</A> and
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Kataoka_90">Kataoka and Ichirose (1990)</A>. It introduces a known fictitious desired
signal during noise-only periods in order to adapt the filters to
cancel such signal and therefore improve the quality of the speech
parts. One drawback of this technique is the need for accurate
speech/non-speech detection.

<P>
Some efforts have been reported applying the adaptive beamforming
techniques to the near-field case. In <A
 HREF="node147.html#McCowan_00">McCowan, Marro and Mauuary (2000)</A> and
<A
 HREF="node147.html#McCowan_01">McCowan et&nbsp;al. (2001)</A> adaptive beamforming and super-directive
beamforming are combined for this effect.

<P>
In real applications none of the previously described beamforming
techniques achieves the levels of improvement on the signal set
theoretically. In practice a post-processing of the acoustic
signal is necessary in order to obtain the optimum output quality.
In <A
 HREF="node147.html#Zelinski_88">Zelinski (1988)</A> a Wiener post-filtering is applied
where time delays information is used to further enhance the
signal in the filter. In <A
 HREF="node147.html#Marro_98">Marro et&nbsp;al. (1998)</A> it does a very
thorough analysis of the interaction of Wiener filtering with a
filter&amp;sum beamforming, showing that the post-filter can cancel
incoherent noise and allows for slight errors in the estimated
array steering. Other post-filtering approaches applied to
microphone arrays beamforming are proposed in
<A
 HREF="node147.html#Cohen_02">Cohen and Berdugo (2002)</A> and <A
 HREF="node147.html#Valin_04">Valin et&nbsp;al. (2004)</A>.

<P>
There are many post-processing techniques aimed to the
``enhanced'' single channel signal resulting from the beamforming.
Some of them take into account acoustic considerations
(<A
 HREF="node147.html#Rosca_03">Rosca et&nbsp;al. (2003)</A>, <A
 HREF="node147.html#Zhang_04">Zhang et&nbsp;al. (2004)</A>) or acoustic models
(<A
 HREF="node147.html#Brandstein_01">Brandstein and Griebel, 2001</A>) to better enhance the signal.
