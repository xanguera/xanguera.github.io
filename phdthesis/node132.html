Data used on the Speaker Diarization Evaluations</A>
</H2>

<P>
The test datasets used in both RT05s and RT06s evaluations were
composed of conference and lecture type data. The conference data
is composed of ten and nine meeting excerpts of 12 minutes each.
One meeting was eliminated from RT06s after the evaluation
finished for technical issues. These datasets have been used in
this thesis to evaluate the different proposed techniques and are
covered in mode detail in the experiments chapter and in appendix
<A HREF="node146.html#rt_data_info">B</A>.

<P>
The lecture room data for test was composed of excerpts of
different sizes contributed by the different partners in the CHIL
project and corresponding to different instants in a lecture
meeting. In particular:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>RT05s test data was composed of 29 excepts, all recorded at
Karlsruhe University. Up to thee excepts were selected from each
meeting, but systems were not expected to process the data from
each meeting together. The majority of data corresponded to the
lecturer, resulting in many excerpts where only one person was
speaking. The shortest excerpt was 69 seconds and the longest 468
seconds.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>RT06s test data was composed of 38 excerpts of five minutes
each, recorded in 5 different CHIL meeting rooms: 4 at AIT, 4 at
IBM, 2 at ITC, 24 at Karlsruhe and 4 at UPC. This year the
excerpts were chosen to contain a bigger variety of speakers and
situations. After the evaluation finished, the set was reduced to
28 excerpts for technical reasons.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The development data used in these evaluations was usually a
compilation of the data sets from previous evaluation campaigns.
The used sets for conference room data were from RT02s and RT04s
evaluations for RT05s, and a subset of RT02s through RT05s for the
RT06s evaluation. For the lecture room evaluations, as this
subdomain was first included in the evaluation in RT05s, there was
no prior datasets available and therefore NIST distributed a set
of transcribed lecture recordings similar to those in RT05s. For
RT06s development was done using a subset of the original
development set plus the RT05s evaluation set.

<P>
Although the diarization system does not use any training data,
the speech/non-speech detector used in RT05s needed to be trained.
It used around 80 hours of meetings data extracted from the ICSI
meeting corpus.
