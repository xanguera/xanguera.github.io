Speaker Diarization: from Broadcast News to Meetings
</H1>

<P>
When applying a known technique to a new task it is preferable to
do it starting from some well rooted theory and some
implementation that has been proven to be successful in a task
similar to the proposed one, while analyzing its shortcoming on
this new domain and proposing improvements to it. This is the case
of the diarization system presented for the meetings environment,
which is based on the system previously developed at the
International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) for the task of
broadcast news. It has been developed by proposing alternatives to
the algorithms that had some room for improvement or that needed
to be adapted to better fit the new domain. Also, given that the
broadcast news system is designed to run only on a single-channel
recording, the necessary algorithms have also been implemented to
adapt the signals from multiple channels/microphones to be able to
process them with the presented system.

<P>
This chapter covers the description of both the broadcast news
system and the new meetings domain system, bridging the gap
between both by analyzing the differences that have been observed
during development.

<P>
In the first part, the broadcast news system is described in
detail, pointing out the main ideas behind it and its
implementation, and baseline results are shown regarding its
performance for the NIST Rich transcription evaluations for
broadcast news (RT03s and RT04f) in which ICSI participated.

<P>
Following the broadcast news description, a comparison on some of
the parameters measurable on both domains (meetings and broadcast
news) is offered. The differences between them are pointed out, as
well as the areas where this thesis proposes improvements in
converting a system from one task to the other.

<P>
Finally, a description of the meetings domain speaker diarization
system is given. The detailed description of all the novel
algorithms involved in the new system is split between the current
and next two chapters. In this chapter a detailed description is
given of those algorithms that have been adapted from different
sources but that are not considered a novelty of this thesis by
themselves. It also gives an overview description of the rest of
the algorithms (novel in this thesis) to obtain a complete view of
the overall system.

<P>
The techniques considered to be the primary contribution of this
thesis will be described in chapters <A HREF="node61.html#acoustic_modeling">4</A>,
focusing in those algorithms within the single-channel speaker
diarization system, and <A HREF="node82.html#multich_process">5</A> which deals with the
use of the multiple channels in a meeting room to further improve
the system.
